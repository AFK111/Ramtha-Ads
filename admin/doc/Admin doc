/***********Start important notes***********/

-- if the user don't allow to use cookies , that will cause a problem with the our website because the value
	of 'session.use_trans_sid' var in 'php.ini' file is equal to 0 and that means the session ID(session info)
	 won't move from one page to another automatically , and we havn't move it manually . 

	 so either prevent the user who don't want to use cookie to use our website or 
	 move the session ID manually or , or change the value of 'session.use_trans_sid'
	 to 1 to move it automatically(this way has some drawbacks). 


-- any thing snet or modify http headers must be used before html output and if that happens the error 'headers sent' will appear .
	
	there are many reasons to cause this problem , to avoid it use ob_start() and ob_end() functions at the start and the end of
	the page like in dashboard .

	ob : output buffering .
